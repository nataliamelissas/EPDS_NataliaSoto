          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I am a software engineer that is always eager to learn and leave things better than I found them. I graduated from the University of Utah with a B.S. in Computer Science and have had various professional software engineer roles that have given me valuable experience. Among my achievements was working on a three-person frontend team that launched a new user interface for customers utilizing cutting-edge frontend technologies such as React, Typescript, and Apollo GraphQL. I then played a key role in enhancing the user and developer experience by implementing a more feature-rich and robust API server in Scala. More recently, I successfully helped launch a new e-commerce checkout experience involving significant frontend and backend API changes. I worked with similar technologies, as before, in addition to AWS, and popular e-commerce APIs.</p>
          <p>Beyond technical accomplishments, I have been actively involved with STEM education organizations. In 2018, I taught and developed a Python Game Development course at the University of Utah's K-12 summer coding camp. Additionally, I organized networking events, hosted technical workshops, and maintained the Society of Women Engineers WordPress website for an academic year. In 2019, I played a key role in launching Club Ability, a local Utah organization that fosters diversity in STEM and provides coding education to K-12 students.</p>
